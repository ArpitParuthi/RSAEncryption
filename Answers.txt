I was not able to compile my assignment without using the package property.

The commands to compile my programs are as following:
javac Assignment_6/KeyGen.java
javac Assignment_6/Encode.java
javac Assignment_6/Decode.java
javac Assignment_6/EncodeString.java
javac Assignment_6/DecodeInts.java
javac Asssignment_6/RSA.java

The commands to run my programs are:
java Assignment_6/KeyGen
java Assignment_6/Encode
java Assignment_6/Decode
java Assignment_6/EncodeString
java Assignment_6/DecodeInts
java Assignment_6/RSA 10
java Assignment_6/RSA encrypt Sample.txt
java Assignment_6/RSA decrypt Sample.txt.enc

Answers for question 1 through 9 are as follows:

1) a) Program KeyGen.java, b) Program Encode.java, c) Program Decode.java
2) 16
3) {
4) Q
5) 187, Decoded to character z (If it is to be encoded, 100)
6) Alice's private key is 187. Using d=187,
	112 is decoded as "A" (with a cap)
	359 is decoded as A BLANK
	296 is decoded as "x"
	113 is decoded as "1" (superscript)
7) Program EncodeString.java
8) Program DecodeInts.java
9) Program RSA.java, all parts a),b), and c) are performed by the program using XGCD()
